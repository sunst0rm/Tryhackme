Today task is very easy. The point is to use `Burp Suite` and `Intruder` to perform a bruteforce attack and get username/password

Once I type in manually username as:

`root`
`admin`
`user`

and then as password:

`password`
`12345`
`admin`

A program finds out a combination which turns out to be correct.

# What is the flag?
